This is a project for [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001) provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). 

In this project, I was provided with [art assets together with some starter code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game). Using these tools I should clone the game in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2JhGrrwLuQ&feature=youtu.be). 

Click [this link](http://g7845123.github.io/frogger) for a demo of this game. 

If Your browser does not support canvas element, you may see an empty page instead of the game. In this case, you may try to use the Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome browser.
