This is a project for [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001) provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). 

In this project, I was provided with [art assets together with some starter code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game). Using these tools I should clone the game in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2JhGrrwLuQ&feature=youtu.be). 

All Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc. that I referred to or used are listed in "references.txt".
